Prompt generator

This is version 1.2 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

It has image prompts and text prompts

Current version 1.2.1

Changes:

    Fixed a glitch where it called break at an incorrect time in the promptManager interface

    Made some improvements to the PromptPnl

    Chenged the name of promptMissing to NoMorePrompts and changed the "text to out of prompts"

    Fixed a glitch where if it didn't have the starting folder it would never do anything 
        (I checked for the sub starting folders existed but not the absolute starting folder)

    Fixed a glitch where it would try to display a null image when confronted with an unsupported image type

Planned changes:

    I might even make a way to get random prompts from both of the prompt types

    I may also make sound prompts (Sounds interesting)
