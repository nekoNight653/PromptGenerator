Prompt generator

This is version 1.3 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

It has image prompts, text prompts, and a way to get prompts from all prompt types

Current version 1.3.1 (A very small o.o.1)

Changes:

    Minor output improvements


Planned changes:


    I might make a way to enable and disable prompt panels (I mean if I start making lot's of prompt panels it would be useful)

    I may also make sound prompts (Sounds kinda interesting)
