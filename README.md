Prompt generator

This is version 1.2 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

It has image prompts and text prompts

Current version 1.2.2

Changes:

    Actually fixed a glitch where text would increase the gui size,
    and then that would consequently increase the image size limit to beyond what you could see

Planned changes:

    I might even make a way to get random prompts from both of the prompt types

    I may also make sound prompts (Sounds interesting)
