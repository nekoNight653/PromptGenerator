"#Prompt generator"

This is version 1.1 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

This is the branch for the upcoming version 1.2

Current version 1.2.0

Changes: 

    The readme

Planned changes:

    Capability to store and get random images (This was the idea of my "client"(Family member))

    So that it's a little better than a random number generator I'm also going to make it genre seperated for the images
