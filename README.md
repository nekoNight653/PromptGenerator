Prompt generator

This is version 1.2 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

It has image prompts and text prompts

Current version 1.2.4

Changes:

    Made the prompts panel scroll (This will be required for making any more prompt panels)

    Made the Prompt class tuple thing back into a record

    Added a genFolders method to the 2 of the three prompt manager classes. It just reduces code

    Made an all prompt type manager that gets prompts from anywhere

    Made an all prompt type panel that outputs prompts from anywhere

    Made a prompt type enum for being able to tell what type a prompt is and also for getting various things from each prompt type

    Added to the Prompt record which type a prompt is

    Slightly changed the gerParamedRandPrompts function to work without the getGenre from name method


Planned changes:

    I'm going to make a way to get random prompts from all of the prompt types 

    I'll probably make a way to enable and disable prompt panels (I mean if I start making lot's of prompt panels it would be useful)

    I may also make sound prompts (Sounds interesting)
