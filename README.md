Prompt generator

This is version 1.2 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

It has image prompts and text prompts

Current version 1.2.4

Changes:

    Made a panel for misc buttons like  "clear output"

    Made it so that image prompts always output on a different thread rather than just when the number requested is over 4,
    because I fond that depending on the image they could take a while

    A few more cleanliness improvements


Planned changes:

    I might even make a way to get random prompts from both of the prompt types

    I may also make sound prompts (Sounds interesting)
