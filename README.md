Prompt generator

This is version 1.1 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

This is the branch for the upcoming version 1.2 (I upload my active progress on it)

Current version 1.2.0 (Not quite version 1.2.0 yet hasn't really "released" (I haven't handed it over to the person I'm making it for))

Changes:

    Went a little wild with abstracting (pretty sure this counts as abstracting) by adding an interface for both the ImagePrompts class and the TextPrompts class

    Made an abstract class for both the textPrompt and imagePrompt panels

    Got a working start of the ImagePrompts class there are still things that need to be added but it kind of works

    Made progress on the GUI

Planned changes:

    Ability to interface with the iamge prompts class from the GUI

    And I might even make a way to get random prompts from both of the prompt types
