"#Prompt generator"

This is version 1.1 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

This is the branch for the upcoming version 1.2

Current version 1.2.0 (Maybe technically 1.2.1 but the first version was just me syncing the code with the new branch)

Changes: 

    Made it so the combo boxes updated whenever the genre files were changed

    Made a panel that has two panels one for text based prompt management and the other for image based prompt management

    with a label above each of them

    Made genreToDelete a combo box (I'm not sure it's a good change it's easier to misclick delete a genre so I might revert this)

    Renamed a lot of things

Planned changes:

    Capability to store and get random images

    So that it's a little better than a random number generator I'm also going to make it genre seperated for the images
