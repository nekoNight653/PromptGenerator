Prompt generator

This is a simple program that writes prompts to a file and then retrieves them.

This was built for a writer to get random prompt ideas.

This is the version 1.1.0 work in progress.

This version will have make it, so you can separate prompts by type (Such as genre, location, etc. Really anything you want since it'll be up to the user).

There will be a button for creating a file with a name of your choosing.

Then the get prompts button will be able to choose which file/files (I haven't decided if I should make it so you can just choose 1 or all or if you can specify multiple specific files) you will get x random prompts from.

This is going to be a lot of changes, so I guess I'll slowly upload them to github under the branch version-1.1.0
