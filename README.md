Prompt generator

This is a simple program that writes prompts to a file and then retrieves them.

This was built for a writer to get random prompt ideas.

This is version 1.0.0. In the next version 1.1.0 I plan to make it so you can separate prompts by type (Such as gener, location, etc).

Also note pushing the .idea was a mistake
