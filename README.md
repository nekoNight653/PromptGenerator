Prompt generator

This is version 1.2 of the prompt generator

This version allows you to separate prompts by genre.

You have complete control over what the genres are.

You can get random prompts either completely randomly (random genres too), 

or you can specify which genres and how many from said genre you want!

It has image prompts and text prompts

Current version 1.2.3

Changes:

    Fixed the refactoring mistake that happened making my frame called PromptGeneratorPackage.PromptGenerator 

    Made the outputImg function throw a BadLocation exception rather than handling it itself
    (It didn't have a way to get the image name)

    Slight improvements to the cleansliness of the code.


Planned changes:

    I might even make a way to get random prompts from both of the prompt types

    I may also make sound prompts (Sounds interesting)
