/*
* Like the class textPrompts is for managing string based prompts this is for managing image based prompts.
*
* It really seems like I should be able to have some parent class for both of them which has some base features,
* but after thinking for a little while I couldn't find much without going too far out of my way for it.
*
* Like perhaps, I could declare what methods you'd need (for a fully working prompt manager. Such as creating, getting and deleting genres and prompts)
* and pass in generics, but it didn't seem worth it since the code has to work slightly differently for each of them anyways
* and I won't be using those methods elsewhere in the class.
*
* They still seem so close
